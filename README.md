Diabetes Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on predicting diabetes based on a healthcare dataset using machine learning. The dataset includes various features such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and the presence of diabetes.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (optional)
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/diabetes-prediction.git
cd diabetes-prediction
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Usage
Open a Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python environment.

Run the following code to load and display the dataset:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('/path/to/your/dataset.csv')
df.head()
Explore and analyze the dataset using the available features.

Train a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on the dataset.

python
Copy code
import pickle

# Assuming 'scaler' is your trained model
pickle.dump(scaler, open('Diabetes_RandomForestClassifier.pkl', 'wb'))
